 -a, --all              不限于只对和当前进程的用户 id 相同的进程进行
                        名称-进程id 转换
 -s, --signal <信号>     发送指定的信号
 -q, --queue <信号>      使用 sigqueue(2) 代替 kill(2)
 -p, --pid              打印 pid 而不向它们发送信号
 -l, --list [=<信号>]   列出信号名，或将一个信号转换为名称
 -L, --table            列出信号名和数值

 -h, --help     显示此帮助并退出
