Options:
 -a, --all              do not restrict the name-to-pid conversion to processes
                        with the same uid as the present process
 -s, --signal <sig>     send specified signal
 -q, --queue <sig>      use sigqueue(2) rather than kill(2)
 -p, --pid              print pids without signaling them
 -l, --list [=<signal>] list signal names, or convert one to a name
 -L, --table            list signal names and numbers

 -h, --help     display this help and exit
 -V, --version  output version information and exit

For more details see kill(1).

 -s, --signal <sig>     send specified signal
 -q, --queue <sig>      use sigqueue(2) rather than kill(2)
 -p, --pid              print pids without signaling them
 -l, --list [=<signal>] list signal names, or convert one to a name
 -L, --table            list signal names and numbers

 -h, --help     display this help and exit

Usage:
 kill [options] <pid|name> [...]

Options:
 -a, --all              do not restrict the name-to-pid conversion to processes
                        with the same uid as the present process
 -s, --signal <sig>     send specified signal
 -q, --queue <sig>      use sigqueue(2) rather than kill(2)
 -p, --pid              print pids without signaling them
 -l, --list [=<signal>] list signal names, or convert one to a name
 -L, --table            list signal names and numbers

 -h, --help     display this help and exit
 -V, --version  output version information and exit

For more details see kill(1).

 -s, --signal <sig>     send specified signal
 -q, --queue <sig>      use sigqueue(2) rather than kill(2)
 -p, --pid              print pids without signaling them
 -l, --list [=<signal>] list signal names, or convert one to a name
 -L, --table            list signal names and numbers

 -h, --help     display this help and exit

 -s, --signal <sig>     send specified signal
 -q, --queue <sig>      use sigqueue(2) rather than kill(2)
 -p, --pid              print pids without signaling them
 -l, --list [=<signal>] list signal names, or convert one to a name
 -L, --table            list signal names and numbers

 -h, --help     display this help and exit
