## What's current practice?
- time metrics
- complexity?
- how to measure it?

## Docker image is ready

- Have a start and check program?
- Make command optional?
- Active check if image is correct and can run? ( just suppose it? )
  //people want to know error early

## How's the configuration?
- Where does it pull config?
- Design a new config? ( only env? configmap to local )
  //it's just a file ( or multiple file? ) ( both ok )
- How they change the config
- When will it in effect to the platform?  ( re-online? )

## Create project on our platform
- Project should be anytime to fill ( only need info )
- Process can progress anytime
- control at last minutes?
  how's resource control?  (since we use docker)

- Have a single page for online?
  //what's info need ( the must part )
- Even provide api for automation ( store kylin.yaml file in git ? )
  //this is for automation ( for all time )

For the first time ( may need human involve, generate the kylin.yaml too )

## Push to registry, wait to replicate to production env
-   //time consuming part
-   //how to reduce this time?

## Domain name and Nginx config
- both need api to be ready ( not ready for now )

## Others
- How to self help during the process
- Provide much help tips?
