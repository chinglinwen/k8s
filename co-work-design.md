# Co-work design ( draft )

## collaborate workflows design too
  //this need much work? robot tools, code review, git 
  
  //plan first, everyone take a responsibilities, periodic share status
  
  //use git to report the status, every can join for the feedbacks

## stableness/reliabilities ( focus, make sure, thinking the whole line )?
  //with all should be focus on this though

## fedoration? ( just to know more )

## upgrade ( lifecycle management, k8s new version research? )
    //hpa ( auto scale? )
    
## monitoring ( more about business monitor ) ( and standardization )

## testing ( also pushing qa-team to test on k8s platform )

## workflows ( app onlines )

## docker ( container ) ( know much detail )


## networking ( care that much, even compare multiple solution )

## storage ( more about testing, know the internal too, handle much problems )

## k8s-internal ( unerstanding more about k8s, logic? component based first )
  //this everyone need to know, at least basic concept

## k8s-dns? ( monitoring, bug finding, testing, etc )

## k8s outer analysis
how's our business apps like, does it fit, may also help other to jump in docker ? )

## k8s app helper ( experience research? )
//k8s business app bench? delegate to qa team?

## ingress ( service access )
how it works, internal, troubleshooting, config, and so testing too

## external torelance (  outer ha? )
