# Co-work design ( draft )

## collaborate workflows design too

How do we work together, gitea ( issues, label, milestones )

this need much work? code review, git, robot tools? practice this often
  
plan first, everyone attack an areas, periodic share status
  
use git to report the status, everyone can join for the feedbacks

## stableness/reliabilities
focus, make sure, thinking the whole line?
with all should be focus on this though

## online workflows ( simplify app onlines? )
workflow smooth? platform change?

## k8s outer analysis
how's our business apps like, does it fit, may also help other to jump in docker ?

## configuration
Configmap, Find out a better solution? secret's security concern?

## logging
Container logging persistent solution?

## example apps
Create many examples ( need representative? ), see if something will go wrong

## external torelance
outer ha?

## k8s-dns?
dns monitoring, bug finding, testing, etc


## k8s new version research?
k8s base, make upper layer (better solution ) possible

## monitoring
more about business monitor and monitoring standardization? 

## testing
pushing qa-team to test on k8s platform

## container ( docker first)
what need to be done? dockerfile, dockerimage helper? standard image for every app?

## networking
care that much, even compare multiple solution

## storage ( big task )
more about testing, know the internal too, handle much problems

## k8s-internal
unerstanding more about k8s, logic? component based first

this everyone need to know, at least basic concept

## k8s app helper ( experience research? )
//k8s business app bench? delegate to qa team?

## ingress ( service access )
how it works, internal, troubleshooting, config, and so testing too

## fedoration? 
just to know more ( still alpha? ), not in early stage?

## others
1. lifecycle management
1. hpa ( auto scale? ) later?
